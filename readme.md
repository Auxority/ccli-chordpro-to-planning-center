# CCLI SongSelect to Planning Center integration

*Note that this userscript **requires** an active PlanningCenter and CCLI SongSelect subscription.*

## Usage

*Note that this might not work in Google Chrome due to Manifest V3*

1. Install the [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/get-it/) extension.
2. Install the [userscript](https://github.com/Auxority/ccli-chordpro-to-planning-center/raw/refs/heads/main/index.user.js)

## The problem

PlanningCenter does not import ChordPro files automatically. Adding editable songs is a 24-step process, which is too complicated for most people.

## The goal

This project aims to automate the 24-step process through a userscript.
